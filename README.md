## FE Task Drill

•⁠ ⁠Using this mock API:

https://reqres.in/

•⁠ ⁠Please open a new codesandbox (best is to login using github etc. So that it saves your work), and use the React template.
•⁠ ⁠Create a *table (html table, no external libs)* with the following columns:

First name, last name, email, avatar. No pagination needed.

•⁠ ⁠*Display* users from the mock api in the table According to the columns above.

•⁠ ⁠Allow to *add* a new user with simple html validations on the fields.

•⁠ ⁠Allow to *delete* a user from the table by clicking on “X” on the user’s row. Before deleting the user a confirmation alert should popup (a simple Javascript Alert).

•⁠ ⁠Note: the logic should be in a custom hook where the component itself has no effects.

•⁠ ⁠Bonus: allow to sort / filter the table (client-side sort only) by first / last name.
